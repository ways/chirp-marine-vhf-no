# CSV files for CHIRP

Tested with Baofeng.


## marine_vhf.csv

marine_vhf.csv is an improved Chirp (http://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home) file for VHF marine channels. Stock "Marine VHF channels" did not match marine channel numbers with baofeng channel numbers. Fixing with Kanalbruk.htm from http://trudelutt.com/linker/vhf_kanaler_nor.htm as source.

I'm not sure where L and F channels are usually placed, or which countries use them, so I put them at 30-35 to "save" memory slots. Let me know if there's a standard numeric location for them.

Also removed all Skip flags, as I'd like all channels to be scanned. Open for input on which are pointless to scan (like AIS?).

TODO:
* Check if Chirp wants to use this as new generic maritime config: http://chirp.danplanet.com/issues/3853
